`ðŸŽ‰ This is my first post!`

I've been dreaming of creating my own programming language for years, and today, I'm thrilled to introduce you to Mine! ðŸš€

## My Journey So Far

Before diving into Mine, let me take you on a quick tour of my programming language adventures. It all started with [Quantum Cobra](https://replit.com/@pjdurable/Cobra-Interpreter-Advanced-4v=1#main.py), a project that ignited my passion for language design. Then came [Quantum](/assets/quantum.html), a unique language that transpiles its code to Python before executing. Along the way, I also created a few other languages, each with its own quirks and features:

- **Equalang**
    > A mathematical programming language for evaluating expressions and equations. Perfect for math enthusiasts!

- **Minilang**
    > A programming language with a syntax similar to Python. Simple, yet powerful.

- **Quantum**
    > Written in Python itself, but transpiles its code to Python before executing. A fun experiment in language design.

## Introducing Mine

Now, let's talk about Mine, the latest and greatest in my lineup of programming languages. Mine is the culmination of everything I've learned so far, and I'm excited to share it with you.

### Why Mine?

Mine is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced programmers. Whether you're looking to build a simple script or a complex application, Mine has got you covered.

### Getting Started

You can install Mine from the releases page at [https://github.com/Pjdur/Mine](https://github.com/Pjdur/Mine). It's super easy to get started, and you'll be up and running in no time.

> **NOTE:** Do NOT use the install scripts on [https://pjdur.github.io/Mine](https://pjdur.github.io/Mine). They are broken and will be fixed later. Mine is also not production-ready and is still beta. Stay tuned for updates!

### Syntax Overview

Curious about Mine's syntax? Check out the detailed documentation here: [Mine.md](./assets/Mine.md). You'll find everything you need to know to start coding in Mine.

### Join the Community

If you find this project fun or worth contributing to, consider becoming a contributor! Your help can make Mine even better. Let's build something amazing together.

Thank you for joining me on this journey. I can't wait to see what you'll create with Mine!

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
