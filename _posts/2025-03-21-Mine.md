# Mine 
`ðŸŽ‰ This is my first post!`

I've been wanting to make my own programming language for years.
First I've made [Quantum Cobra](https://replit.com/@pjdurable/Cobra-Interpreter-Advanced-4v=1#main.py). Second, I made [Quantum](_posts/assets/quantum.py.md). After those, I've made a few minor programming languages, written in Python. Some are listed here:

- Equalang
    > A mathematical programming language for evaluating expressions and equations

- Minilang
    > A programming language with a syntax similar to Python.

- Quantum 
    > Written in Python itself, but transpiles its code to Python before executing

### Mine

Mine is the current programming language I work on. Most other ones I made are discontinued and not maintained anymore.

You can install Mine from the releases page at [https://github.com/Pjdur/Mine](https://github.com/Pjdur/Mine).

> NOTE: Do NOT use the install scripts on [https://pjdur.github.io](https://pjdur.github.io). They are broken and will be fixed later.

Mine's syntax is detailed here: [Mine.md](./assets/Mine.md)

If you like this project and think it's fun or worth contributing, consider becoming a contributor and help with the programming language.
